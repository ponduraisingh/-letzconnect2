<p>A teacher once beautifully explained to her students the difference between knowledge and wisdom. She said that unknowingly both the words become synonymous with each other, but the difference still exists. Knowledge, she said refers to all the information we have gathered through our education and wisdom comes into play depending on how we use that education in life. This is the purpose of doing an internship.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges that young adults face after completing their higher education is their transition to working in a company or an organization. Though our Indian education system aims at the holistic development of every individual, unfortunately, a proper platform is not always provided to utilize the skills and talents found in the individuals.</p>

<p>College students juggle with assignments, tests, and extra-curricular activities on a regular basis. Internships play a huge role in helping students find their perfect career path. Through a continuous process of trial and error, every individual can strive to find their strengths which can be better utilized and weaknesses that can be improved in the future.</p>

<p><strong>What is an internship?</strong></p>

<p>Cambridge Dictionary defines an internship as, &ldquo;A period of time during which a student works for a company or organization in order to get an experience of a particular type of work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this article, the top 5 reasons to take up an internship are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>1) New people. New experiences.</strong></p>

<p>The best place to implement what you have learnt is at an internship. Only when you have hands-on job experience, you will be able to understand reality and what it requires to stay relevant and connected to the world. Getting an opportunity to tune and hone the required skills whilst being open-minded and having adequate grasping power to learn new things, provides the perfect space for an individual to grow.</p>

<p>For example, a student pursuing Journalism or English Literature will know how to write for a company only when they get the chance to do so, as academic writing is different from what every job might require for content writing. Getting a chance to intern in any firm for writing will help the writer improve their style, diction and their structure of writing.</p>

<p><strong>2) Skyrocket your resume</strong></p>

<p>Any internship you take up depending on the recruiter can be paid or unpaid, but the entire process is worthwhile and very valuable. Being in a competitive capitalistic society, there is always a race amongst everyone trying to establish their career. In this case, an internship could be the reason why you are selected in an interview amidst a large group of people.</p>

<p>Getting a certificate for completing the internship or at instances receiving a letter of recommendation from your recruiter could help the person in the long run. Seeking a spot in any university or college for pursuing higher studies after doing an internship adds more credits to their application.</p>

<p>Online internships sponsored by MyCaptain official are one of the popular platforms that provide students with a crash course filled with a number of tasks and led by mentors from various experienced fields. Internships definitely help in making your resumes attractive for the employer.</p>

<p><strong>3) Widen your connections</strong></p>

<p>Taking up an internship enables the students to meet new people experienced in their stream of choice. It helps them find their community which keeps them updated about the advancements in their career paths. Meeting new managers, senior employees and colleagues will give you a wider and better perspective on what to expect from the industry. At times even after the internship, you could be called back for a full-time job in the same company or organization.</p>

<p><strong>4) Discover your passion</strong></p>

<p>Doing an internship gives any student the proper opportunity to discover their passion. Sometimes, what the course at college offers could be different from what the actual job requires in the real world.</p>

<p>An internship not just provides the student with a platform to showcase and apply their skills, but gives them an overall idea on what to expect from the industry. Investing time being an intern will help you decide if that is the particular space you are looking to establish your career in.</p>

<p>It helps them understand the groove of working in an office each posing a set of exciting challenges and tasks to keep them occupied. Discovering your passion will help in setting your mind on the goal to be achieved. In the end, doing what you love every day will make a difference and create a sense of satisfaction in any individual.</p>

<p><strong>5) Step out with confidence</strong></p>

<p>Being an intern will definitely boost your confidence. Learning to carry yourself in the work environment and getting used to the office jargon will mould your calibre and behaviour. It inculcates the discipline needed when adapting to a profession. Communication skills can be finely tuned according to what the industry requires.</p>

<p>Being a part of a team will certainly impact the way you learn how to work together and also in displaying your uniqueness, adding value to the team. Having had the experience to practically apply your academic knowledge in the field will make the transition from college to work easier and interesting in the future.</p>
